            <p class="text-body-secondary mb-4">
              I'm a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Illinois (UIUC), where I built a strong foundation in software and systems, complemented by minors in Mathematical Statistics and Data Science. I enjoy bridging the gap between a tough engineering problem and the insights hidden within its data.

            <h3 class="h5 text-light mt-4">A Strategic Approach</h3>
            <p class="text-body-secondary mb-4">
              I've always been drawn to pursuits that reward strategic thinking. From competitive video games to classic games like poker and chess, I'm fascinated by systems where success comes from a blend of analytical skill and psychological insight. More than just the competition, I enjoy the process of self-improvement, studying my decisions, learning from my mistakes, and getting measurably better over time.

            <h3 class="h5 text-light mt-4">Learning and Exploration</h3>
            <p class="text-body-secondary mb-4">
                My curiosity doesn't stop with my formal education. I'm a big believer in learning from different fields to improve my own thinking. Right now, I'm reading through "The Great Mental Models" series. The first volume was fantastic, and the second one is giving me new frameworks from physics and chemistry to apply to problem-solving in a technical world. It’s all about building a versatile toolkit for thought.

            <h3 class="h5 text-light mt-4">Beyond the Keyboard</h3>
            <p class="text-body-secondary">
              When I'm not focused on a project, I like to recharge with friends. I'm a huge fan of watching movies, especially the kind you can really dig into afterward. Half the fun for me is the conversation that follows, breaking down the plot, characters, and what made a story resonate. It’s a fun, collaborative way to appreciate the details and craft that go into great work. I can't wait for <i>Dune: Messiah</i> !!

                Chess has always been a favorite of mine. I appreciate its clarity. There's no luck, just a series of decisions and consequences. It's a great reminder of the importance of focus and thinking several steps ahead.
